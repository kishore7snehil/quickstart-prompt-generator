# Quickstart Documentation Generation Request

I need you to create comprehensive quickstart documentation that combines technical SDK analysis with established documentation style patterns. This will help Svelte developers quickly get started with Auth0 SPA JS SDK.

## Context & Goals
- **SDK**: Auth0 SPA JS SDK (JavaScript)
- **Target Framework**: Svelte
- **Goal**: Create developer-friendly quickstart documentation that follows proven patterns

## Inputs to Synthesize

### 1. SDK Technical Analysis
*[Paste the complete output from Stage 1: SDK Deep Analysis here]*

### 2. Reference Style Guide
*[Paste the complete style guide from Stage 2: Reference Style Extraction here]*

## Generation Requirements

### Content Requirements
1. **Follow the extracted style patterns** - match the tone, structure, and approach from the reference analysis
2. **Framework-Specific Focus** - tailor examples and instructions specifically for Svelte
3. **Complete Workflow** - cover setup through first successful implementation
4. **Practical Examples** - provide working code that developers can copy and run
5. **Clear Prerequisites** - specify what developers need before starting

### Technical Requirements
1. **Accurate Integration** - ensure all code examples work with Svelte
2. **Best Practices** - incorporate SDK best practices and security considerations
3. **Error Prevention** - address common pitfalls and setup issues
4. **Scalable Foundation** - show patterns that work for real applications, not just demos

### Documentation Structure
**IMPORTANT: Follow the exact structure and organization patterns identified in the Style Extraction analysis above.**

Use the structure pattern from the reference documentation analysis to organize your quickstart. This may vary significantly depending on the type of application (SPA, webapp, backend API, native mobile, etc.) and the specific patterns used by the reference documentation.

Ensure your quickstart matches:
- **Section flow and hierarchy** from the extracted style patterns
- **Content organization approach** identified in the reference analysis  
- **Heading styles and terminology** used in the reference documentation
- **Step progression and grouping** that matches the established patterns

Do NOT use a generic structure - adapt to the specific patterns found in the reference documentation.

## Output Format
Generate the quickstart documentation in Markdown format, ready for publication. Include:
- Clear section headers
- Working code examples with syntax highlighting
- Step-by-step numbered instructions where appropriate
- Callouts for important information (tips, warnings, notes)
- Links to relevant additional resources

## Quality Criteria
The final quickstart should:
- ✅ Allow a Svelte developer to go from zero to working implementation
- ✅ Match the style and approach of the reference documentation
- ✅ Include all necessary setup and configuration steps
- ✅ Provide working, copy-paste code examples
- ✅ Address common developer concerns and potential issues
- ✅ Maintain consistency with Auth0 SPA JS SDK best practices

## Critical Quality Assurance Requirements

Before finalizing the quickstart, ensure it meets these mandatory standards:

### Prerequisites & Environment Setup (MANDATORY)
- ✅ **Complete prerequisites listed** - All system requirements, runtimes, tools, and versions specified
- ✅ **Development environment setup** - Clear instructions for setting up the development environment
- ✅ **Package/dependency management** - Correct installation methods for the target ecosystem
- ✅ **Version compatibility** - Minimum and recommended versions clearly specified

### Language & Framework Compatibility (MANDATORY)
- ✅ **Type system compatibility** - Code examples work with the language's type system (if applicable)
- ✅ **Language conventions followed** - Code follows established patterns and idioms for JavaScript
- ✅ **Framework integration verified** - Examples work with current Svelte patterns and structure
- ✅ **Import/dependency statements complete** - All necessary imports, using statements, or includes provided

### Current Practices & Command Accuracy (MANDATORY)
- ✅ **Current commands used** - No deprecated installation, build, or setup commands
- ✅ **Modern tooling integration** - Works with current package managers, build tools, and CLI utilities
- ✅ **Framework structure accuracy** - File paths and project structure match current Svelte conventions
- ✅ **Ecosystem best practices** - Follows current recommended approaches for the technology stack

### Configuration & External Service Setup (MANDATORY)
- ✅ **External service configuration complete** - Step-by-step setup for any required external services
- ✅ **Configuration value acquisition** - Clear guidance on obtaining API keys, domains, credentials, etc.
- ✅ **Configuration examples provided** - Sample values showing expected format and structure
- ✅ **Common configuration errors prevented** - Proactive guidance on typical setup mistakes

### Error Prevention & Developer Success (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ✅ **Common issues anticipated** - Troubleshooting covers likely problems developers will encounter
- ✅ **Validation checkpoints included** - Clear steps to verify successful setup at each stage
- ✅ **Error context provided** - Explanations help developers understand and resolve issues
- ✅ **Alternative approaches offered** - Backup methods for common failure points

**QUALITY GATE**: The quickstart should be rejected if it fails any MANDATORY requirement above.

---
**Final Goal**: Create quickstart documentation that Svelte developers can follow to successfully integrate Auth0 SPA JS SDK in under 30 minutes, following established documentation patterns for optimal developer experience.
