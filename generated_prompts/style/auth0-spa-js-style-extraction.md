# Reference Documentation Style Analysis

I need to analyze existing quickstart documentation to extract the writing style, structure, and approach that works well for developers. This will help me maintain consistency when creating new quickstart documentation.

## Task Overview
Please analyze the following reference quickstart documentation and extract:
1. **Writing Style & Tone**
2. **Content Structure & Flow** 
3. **Code Example Patterns**
4. **Developer Guidance Approach**

## Reference Documentation
Please analyze these reference quickstart documents:
- https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular/interactive
- https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Writing Style & Tone Analysis
- **Voice & Perspective**: Is it written in first person, second person, or instructional tone?
- **Technical Level**: How technical vs. beginner-friendly is the language?
- **Personality**: Is the tone formal, casual, encouraging, or matter-of-fact?
- **Assumptions**: What level of prior knowledge does it assume from developers?

### 2. Content Structure & Organization
- **Opening Approach**: How does the documentation begin? (overview, prerequisites, direct setup?)
- **Section Flow**: What is the typical progression of topics?
- **Information Hierarchy**: How is information prioritized and organized?
- **Length & Depth**: How comprehensive vs. concise is the content?

### 3. Code Example Patterns
- **Code Style**: How are code examples formatted and presented?
- **Example Complexity**: Are examples minimal/focused or comprehensive/realistic?
- **Code Comments**: How much explanation is provided within code?
- **Multiple Languages**: If applicable, how are multi-language examples handled?

### 4. Developer Guidance & UX
- **Setup Instructions**: How detailed are installation and setup steps?
- **Troubleshooting**: How does it handle potential issues or errors?
- **Next Steps**: How does it guide developers beyond the basic example?
- **Resource Linking**: How does it reference additional documentation or resources?

### 5. Visual & Formatting Elements
- **Headers & Sections**: What heading hierarchy and section structure is used?
- **Callouts & Highlights**: Are there special formatting elements (tips, warnings, notes)?
- **Lists & Bullets**: How is information broken down into digestible pieces?

## Output Format
Please provide a detailed style guide based on your analysis, formatted as:

```markdown
# Style Guide Extract

## Writing Style
[Key characteristics of the writing approach]

## Structure Pattern
[Typical content flow and organization]

## Code Example Style
[How code is presented and explained]

## Developer Experience Focus
[How the documentation guides and supports developers]

## Formatting Conventions
[Visual and structural elements used]
```

## Context for Application
This style analysis will be used to create quickstart documentation for Auth0 SPA JS SDK (JavaScript) targeting Svelte developers. The goal is to maintain consistency with established patterns while creating effective developer onboarding experiences.

---
**Next Steps**: I'll combine this style analysis with SDK technical details to generate a quickstart guide that matches the established documentation patterns.

### 6. Prerequisites & Environment Setup Coverage
- **Prerequisites Approach**: How thoroughly does the documentation cover system requirements and prerequisites?
- **Environment Setup Detail**: What level of detail is provided for development environment configuration?
- **Dependency Management**: How are package managers, build tools, and dependency installations handled?
- **Version Specification**: How are version requirements and compatibility issues communicated?

### 7. Configuration & External Service Setup Patterns
- **Service Configuration**: How does the documentation guide users through external service setup?
- **Credential & API Key Management**: How are configuration values and authentication setup explained?
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: What level of detail is provided for admin dashboards or external setup?
- **Configuration Examples**: How are example values and configuration formats presented?

### 8. Technology Evolution & Current Practices
- **Command Currency**: How does the documentation ensure commands and approaches are current?
- **Framework Compatibility**: How are framework-specific patterns and file structures addressed?
- **Deprecated vs Current**: How does the documentation handle evolution of tools and practices?
- **Ecosystem Integration**: How well does the documentation integrate with current ecosystem patterns?

### 9. Error Prevention & Troubleshooting Approach
- **Problem Anticipation**: How comprehensively does the documentation address potential issues?
- **Troubleshooting Organization**: How are common problems and solutions structured?
- **Error Context**: How much background is provided to help developers understand issues?
- **Validation & Checkpoints**: How does the documentation help developers verify successful setup?
