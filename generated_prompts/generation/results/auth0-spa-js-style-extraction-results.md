# Auth0 SPA JavaScript SDK Style Extraction

Based on my analysis of both Auth0 quickstart styles for Angular and React, I've extracted a comprehensive style guide for Auth0 documentation specifically applied to the SPA JavaScript SDK. This will serve as the foundation for creating a similar Svelte quickstart.

## 1. Document Structure & Organization

### Overall Structure

Auth0 quickstarts follow a clear, progressive structure that guides developers from setup to implementation:

1. **Introduction** - Brief overview of what the quickstart covers
2. **Prerequisites** - Required knowledge, tools, and resources
3. **Setup** - Creating/configuring Auth0 application
4. **Installation** - Adding SDK and dependencies
5. **Implementation** - Step-by-step code implementation
6. **Run the Application** - Testing instructions
7. **Next Steps** - Further resources and advanced topics

### Navigation System

The document employs a "building blocks" approach where each section builds on previous ones:

- **Progressive disclosure**: Starts with the simplest concepts and progressively adds complexity
- **Clear section headers**: H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections
- **Ordered steps**: Numbered steps for sequential tasks
- **Visual cues**: Icons/callouts for important information
- **Tab-based organization**: Allows selecting between different implementation options

## 2. Writing Style & Tone

### Voice & Tone

The Auth0 voice is:

- **Direct and instructional**: "First, install the SDK..."
- **Professional but conversational**: Avoids overly formal language
- **Developer-to-developer**: Assumes technical competence
- **Encouraging**: "Great! You've completed..."
- **Problem-solving oriented**: Focuses on solving specific authentication challenges

### Grammar Patterns

- **Command form for instructions**: "Create a new file", "Import the dependencies"
- **Second person address**: "You will need to...", "Your application will..."
- **Present tense**: "The SDK handles token renewal"
- **Active voice**: "Auth0 verifies the user's identity" (not "The user's identity is verified")
- **Concise sentences**: Typically 1-2 clauses, focused on a single concept

### Technical Terminology

- **Consistent naming**: Always refers to "Auth0 SPA SDK" consistently
- **Technical accuracy**: Precise use of authentication terms (tokens, PKCE, etc.)
- **Defined acronyms**: First use includes expansion ("PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)")
- **Framework-specific language**: Uses Angular/React terminology correctly in respective guides

## 3. Code Sample Presentation

### Code Block Formatting

- **Syntax highlighting**: Language-specific highlighting (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **Complete, working examples**: No pseudo-code, all examples are functional
- **Focused snippets**: Each demonstrates a single concept
- **Progressive building**: Code samples build on previous examples
- **Comments within code**: Explain key lines directly in code blocks
- **Context indicators**: File paths or component names before code blocks

### Code Style

- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript**: Uses ES6+ syntax, async/await
- **Framework best practices**: Follows Angular/React conventions
- **Consistent formatting**: 2-space indentation
- **Descriptive variable names**: Self-documenting code (e.g., `isAuthenticated`, not `auth`)
- **Error handling**: Includes try/catch blocks for authentication operations

### Code Integration

- **Full implementation path**: Shows where and how to integrate auth code
- **Framework-specific patterns**: Uses framework idioms (services in Angular, hooks in React)
- **Progressive enhancement**: Starts with basic auth, adds features (profile, logout, etc.)

## 4. Visual Elements

### UI Components

- **Info boxes**: Blue boxes for additional information
- **Warning boxes**: Orange/yellow boxes for important cautions
- **Code blocks**: Gray backgrounds with syntax highlighting
- **Screenshots**: Dashboard configuration screens with highlighted areas
- **Diagrams**: Auth flow illustrations (used sparingly)

### Iconography

- **Note icons**: For supplementary information
- **Warning icons**: For potential issues
- **Checkmark icons**: For prerequisites or completed steps
- **Framework icons**: Framework logos to visually distinguish versions

## 5. Content Patterns

### Explanation Patterns

- **What & Why**: Explains both implementation and purpose
- **Theory-then-practice**: Brief conceptual explanation before code
- **Real-world context**: Shows practical application scenarios
- **Potential issues**: Highlights common errors and solutions

### Common Sections

#### Prerequisites

- Lists required tools, accounts, and knowledge
- Version requirements clearly stated
- Links to preliminary setup guides if needed

#### Setup

- Step-by-step Auth0 dashboard configuration
- Screenshots of key configuration screens
- Explanation of critical settings (callback URLs, etc.)

#### Installation

- Package manager commands (npm/yarn)
- Required dependencies
- Version compatibility notes

#### Implementation

- Organized by authentication features (login, logout, etc.)
- Each feature has explanation, code sample, and usage example
- Integration points with framework shown explicitly

#### Testing

- Running the application locally
- Expected authentication behaviors
- Troubleshooting common issues

## 6. Auth0 SPA SDK-Specific Patterns

### Authentication Flow Explanation

- **Clear PKCE focus**: Emphasizes PKCE flow for SPAs
- **Security context**: Explains why PKCE is recommended for SPAs
- **Flow diagrams**: Visual representation of auth process (occasionally)

### Key Concepts Coverage

- **Authentication state**: Managing logged-in status
- **Token handling**: Acquiring and using tokens
- **User information**: Accessing user profile data
- **Scopes & permissions**: Explaining scope configuration
- **Error handling**: Common auth errors and resolution

### Framework Integration Focus

**Angular Patterns**:
- Authentication as a service
- Auth guard for route protection
- Injection patterns for components
- Observable pattern for auth state

**React Patterns**:
- Context API for auth state management
- Custom hook for authentication (`useAuth0`)
- Functional component integration
- Protected route components

## 7. Framework-Specific Adaptations

### Angular-Specific Elements

- **Service-based architecture**: Authentication encapsulated in service
- **NgModule configuration**: Proper module setup
- **Route guards**: Implementing `AuthGuard`
- **Observables**: Using RxJS patterns for auth state
- **Template binding**: Using auth state in templates

```typescript
// auth.service.ts example from Angular guide
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthClientConfig, AuthService } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthenticationService {
  // Service implementation
}
```

### React-Specific Elements

- **Context provider**: Auth0Provider component
- **Custom hooks**: useAuth0 hook
- **Functional components**: React functional style
- **Protected routes**: Using auth state for route protection
- **Conditional rendering**: Based on auth state

```jsx
// Example from React guide
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();
  return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>;
};

export default LoginButton;
```

## 8. Adaptation Strategy for Svelte

Based on this style extraction, a Svelte implementation should:

1. **Follow the same overall structure** and progression as the Angular/React guides
2. **Adapt authentication patterns** to Svelte's programming model:
   - Use Svelte stores for auth state management (similar to React context)
   - Create reusable authentication actions as custom functions
   - Implement reactive declarations for derived auth state

3. **Maintain the same tone and clarity** of instruction
4. **Use Svelte-specific patterns** for:
   - Component composition
   - Reactive state management
   - Markup structure
   - Action directives for events

5. **Present a complete solution** that demonstrates:
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Accessing user profile
   - Protecting routes
   - Calling protected APIs

## 9. Common Auth0 Quickstart Components for Adaptation

### Standard Components to Create for Svelte

1. **Auth Service/Store**:
   - Central authentication state management
   - Authentication methods (login, logout, etc.)
   - Token handling functions

2. **User Profile Component**:
   - Display user information
   - Handle loading states

3. **Login/Logout Buttons**:
   - Trigger authentication actions
   - Conditional rendering based on auth state

4. **Protected Route Guard**:
   - Svelte-appropriate route protection
   - Redirect handling for unauthenticated users

5. **Auth-aware API Calls**:
   - Including access tokens in requests
   - Handling token expiration

## 10. Document Quality Characteristics

### General Quality Markers

- **Completeness**: Covers full authentication flow
- **Accuracy**: Technically precise instructions
- **Currency**: References current SDK versions
- **Practicality**: Focuses on working code
- **Progressive**: Builds complexity gradually
- **Self-contained**: Can be followed without external references
- **Troubleshooting**: Addresses common issues

### Success Criteria

A successful Svelte quickstart should enable developers to:

1. Configure Auth0 properly for a Svelte application
2. Implement authentication with minimal code
3. Understand the security model (PKCE)
4. Successfully implement protected routes
5. Access and use authentication state throughout the app
6. Handle common authentication scenarios and errors
