**Example**:
```typescript
// src/lib/auth0.ts - Complete implementation
import { getSession } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function getServerSession(req: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getSession(req);
  return session;
}
```

### 2. **Create Comprehensive Error Prevention Section** (Priority: HIGH)
**Problem**: Limited troubleshooting guidance when implementation fails
